# 🔭 Field of View (FOV) & Focal Lengths

This section controls how much of the scene is visible and how the subject relates to the background. Choosing the right "lens" changes the psychological feel of the image.

> **Pro Tip:** In AI prompting, specifying the millimeter (`mm`) is usually more effective than just describing the lens type.

## 1. Ultra Wide Angle (Fisheye)
Captures an extremely wide field of view (>100°). Creates significant distortion at the edges. Objects close to the camera appear massive, while the background feels very distant.

* **Focal Length:** 8mm – 16mm
* **Best for:** Action sports (GoPro style), massive architectural interiors, surreal artistic effects.

> **Prompts:** `fisheye lens`, `10mm lens`, `GoPro footage`, `distorted view`, `super wide angle`, `curved horizon`, `ultra-wide`

## 2. Wide Lens
Captures a broad scene without the extreme distortion of a fisheye. Great for showing the character *within* their environment (establishing shots).

* **Focal Length:** 16mm – 35mm
* **Best for:** Landscapes, interior design, street photography where context is important.

> **Prompts:** `wide angle lens`, `24mm`, `35mm`, `establishing shot`, `environmental portrait`, `expansive view`

## 3. Standard Focal Length (The "Nifty Fifty")
This mimics the human eye's field of view. It creates a natural, unbiased look with almost zero distortion. It feels "real" and documentary-like.

* **Focal Length:** ~50mm
* **Best for:** General videography, realistic scenes, documentary style, "what you see is what you get."

> **Prompts:** `50mm lens`, `standard view`, `natural perspective`, `human eye view`, `documentary footage`

## 4. Medium Focal Length
Slightly zoomed in compared to the human eye. This is the "sweet spot" for portraits because it flattens facial features slightly (making them look better) and separates the subject from the background.

* **Focal Length:** 50mm – 85mm
* **Best for:** Waist-up portraits, product shots, cinematic dialogue scenes.

> **Prompts:** `85mm lens`, `portrait lens`, `medium shot`, `70mm`, `focused subject`

## 5. Telephoto Lens
Compresses the space. The background appears much closer to the subject than it actually is. This creates a strong "Bokeh" (blur) effect, isolating the subject entirely.

* **Focal Length:** 100mm – 200mm
* **Best for:** Cinematic close-ups, isolating a character in a crowd, beauty shots.

> **Prompts:** `telephoto lens`, `100mm`, `200mm`, `compressed background`, `bokeh`, `shallow depth of field`, `zoom lens`

## 6. Extreme Telephoto (Super Telephoto)
Massive magnification. Used when you cannot get close to the subject. It creates a very flat image where the foreground and background look "stacked" on top of each other.

* **Focal Length:** 300mm – 800mm+
* **Best for:** Wildlife (safari), sports, paparazzi style, moon shots, spy/surveillance shots.

> **Prompts:** `super telephoto`, `400mm`, `800mm`, `wildlife photography`, `sniper view`, `extreme zoom`, `paparazzi shot`

## ⚡ Cheat Sheet: The "Compression" Rule

If you want to control how the background looks relative to your character, use this rule of thumb:

| Effect Desired | Lens to Prompt |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want to see the whole room"** | `16mm` or `Wide Angle` |
| **"I want it to look like real life"** | `50mm` or `Standard Lens` |
| **"I want a blurry background / Cinematic"** | `85mm` or `100mm` |
| **"I want the moon to look huge behind hero"** | `400mm` or `Telephoto` |
